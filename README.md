# Temperature System
The temperature system would let the user know if the room is cold, hot, or warm; if the room is hot, a sound will play from the buzzer. And the users' benefits below show why it is important to build a temperature system:
- Comfort – Allowing users to regulate the room temperature according to their preferences.
- Energy sufficiency – Helping users save energy and avoid unnecessary energy loss, leading to cost savings.
- Users’ health/well-being – Could maintain temperatures that could help prevent cold or heat-related issues such as hypothermia or heatstroke.
